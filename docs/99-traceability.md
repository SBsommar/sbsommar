# Requirements Traceability Matrix – SB Sommar

## What is this document?

A requirements traceability matrix answers three questions for every requirement:

1. **Is it documented?** Where does the requirement come from?
2. **Is it implemented?** Which code makes it work?
3. **Is it verified?** Which test proves it works?

When a requirement has no test, it may be broken without anyone noticing.
When a requirement has no implementation, it is a gap — a feature that is missing.
This document makes those gaps visible so they can be planned and prioritised.

## How to read the columns

### ID

A short, stable reference you can use in issues, pull requests, and commit messages.
For example: `"this PR closes 02-§9.5"`.

The ID appears in **two places**: in this matrix (the Table section below), and inline in the
source document next to the requirement text as an HTML comment. To find requirement `02-§9.5`,
search for `02-§9.5` in either this file or anywhere under `docs/02-requirements/` — it will appear
on the line that says `` `location` is present and non-empty ``.

Format: `{doc}-§{section}.{counter}`

- `02` = the document family the requirement comes from (`02-requirements/`)
- `§9` = the section number inside that family (matches the `## 9.` heading in the topic file that owns §9)
- `.5` = a sequential counter within that section (labels are added top-to-bottom)

The section prefix tells you *which document owns the requirement* and therefore where to look
if you want to read the surrounding context or open a discussion about changing it.
When adding a new requirement to a section, give it the next available number in that section
and add the `<!-- {id} -->` comment to the source doc alongside the entry in this matrix.

Examples:

- `02-§4.2` = second requirement from §4 of `02-requirements/` (lives in the topic file that owns §4)
- `05-§4.1` = first requirement from §4 of `05-DATA_CONTRACT.md`
- `CL-§5.3` = third requirement from §5 of `CLAUDE.md`

The documents requirements are drawn from:

| Prefix | Document |
| --- | --- |
| `02` | `docs/02-requirements/` — what the site must do and for whom (split across topic files; see the index for the redirect map) |
| `05` | `docs/05-DATA_CONTRACT.md` — YAML schema and validation rules |
| `07` | `docs/07-DESIGN.md` — visual design, CSS tokens, accessibility |
| `CL` | `CLAUDE.md` — architectural constraints and quality requirements |

### Requirement

One sentence describing a single, testable thing the system must do.
"Single" matters — if a sentence could be split into two independently verifiable things, it should be.

### Doc Ref

This is **not** where the requirement is stated — it is where the *solution approach* is documented.
It points to the doc that tells a developer *how* to implement the requirement.

Example: the requirement "event date must fall within camp dates" comes from `02-requirements/add-edit-forms.md §9`,
but the implementation rules (date format, range check) are specified in `06-EVENT_DATA_MODEL.md §4`,
so that is the Doc Ref.

A `—` here means no implementation guidance has been written yet.
That is itself a gap worth noting.

### Test(s)

Short IDs that point to tests in the `tests/` directory.
The full mapping from ID to file and describe-suite is in the **Test ID Legend** at the bottom.

Examples:

- `VLD-04..11` = tests VLD-04 through VLD-11 in `tests/validate.test.js`
- `SNP-01` = first test in `tests/snapshot.test.js`

Tests are listed **before** Implementation to reflect the intended order of work:
write the test first, then write the code that makes it pass.

A `—` here means no automated test exists for this requirement.

### Implementation

The file(s) and function(s) in the codebase where the requirement is satisfied.
A `—` means nothing has been built yet.
Notes in parentheses explain partial or incorrect implementations.

### Status

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `covered` | Code exists **and** a test verifies it |
| `implemented` | Code exists, but no automated test |
| `gap` | The requirement has no implementation (and no test) |

`implemented` is not the same as `covered`. Code that is not tested may break silently.
Aim to move all `implemented` rows toward `covered` over time.

### Archived (superseded) requirements

Rows below marked **superseded by 02-§X** describe requirements whose prose has
been moved to `docs/02-requirements/archive.md`. The IDs are kept verbatim because
they are still cited from code and from this matrix; the moved prose is preserved
there for historical context. Refer to that file for the current list of archived
ID ranges.

  02-§83.35 added: offline page must only link to pages functional offline.
  02-§83.34: cache version bumped to sb-sommar-v3.
02-§91.2 updated: token format corrected from "opaque string (e.g. UUID)"
  to `namn_uuid_epoch` with embedded expiry.
2 requirements added for admin token format (02-§91.29–91.30):
  1 covered (02-§91.29: server-side expiry rejection, ADM-09..10).
  1 implemented (02-§91.30: creation script).
§93 Node rate-limit helper replaced by `express-rate-limit` middleware:
  `source/api/rate-limit.js` and `tests/rate-limit.test.js` deleted;
  `app.js` now uses per-route `rateLimit({...})` instances with
  `trust proxy 'loopback'` and standard `Retry-After` / `RateLimit-*`
  headers. Closes CodeQL `js/missing-rate-limiting` alerts 43/44/45.
  5 rows moved from covered to implemented (manual verification replaces
  removed RL-01..05 unit tests of the now-deleted helper).
21 requirements added for the project documentation site (02-§97.1–97.21):
  Pages now enabled (status `built`, source `main` /docs); 02-§97.1–97.3
    moved from gap to implemented based on the GitHub Pages REST API.
  9 implemented — `docs/_config.yml` enables `jekyll-relative-links`;
    `docs/index.md` is the landing page; `01-CONTRIBUTORS.md` points
    readers at the docs site; no new workflows, dependencies, or
    domain config are introduced.
  2 covered (02-§97.13, 02-§97.14) — `README.md` links to the
    published site above the developer setup section and lists every
    docs/*.md file; `tests/readme-docs-link.test.js` verifies both
    (README-DOCS-01..04).
  4 + 4 new tests across `tests/docs-site-config.test.js` (DOCS-CFG-01..04)
    and `tests/readme-docs-link.test.js` (README-DOCS-01..04).
7 hidden-site requirements added for the documentation site (02-§97.15–97.21):
  6 covered, 1 implemented (the policy declaration §97.18).
  Mirrors §1a's intentionally-hidden policy: `docs/robots.txt`
  (`Disallow: /`) blocks every crawler at the docs site root, and
  `docs/_includes/head-custom.html` injects a noindex/nofollow robots
  meta into every rendered page via the Primer theme's standard hook.
  `docs/index.md` no longer links to `https://sbsommar.se`; it carries
  a project-technical reverse-discoverability banner pointing back to
  the source repo, README, and issue tracker on github.com.
  8 new tests across the same suite (DOCS-CFG-05..07, DOCS-IDX-01..05).

20 requirements delivered for the locale overview page (02-§98.1–98.20,
Session 1 of issue #332): 16 covered by unit tests (LOK-01..83),
4 implemented (§98.8 contextual links, §98.14 design-token discipline,
§98.15 mobile breakpoint, §98.20 corner cell) — all four need
manual/browser verification only. See 02-requirements/design-and-content.md §98 and
07-DESIGN.md §6 "Locale overview grid" for the design spec.

## Top Gaps — Prioritised Action List

### High — missing whole features

1. **`02-§2.7` / `02-§15.1`–`02-§15.14` / `02-§36.1`–`02-§36.10` — RSS feed + per-event pages** *(resolved)*
   RSS feed at `/schema.rss` and per-event detail pages at `/schema/{id}/`.
   Architecture: `03-architecture/rendering.md §17–18`. Implementation: `render-rss.js`, `render-event.js`.
   22 covered (RSS-01..12, EVT-01..18), 5 implemented (manual/CI config).

### Low — tooling, design, and accessibility gaps

2. **`CL-§5.1` / `02-§32.1`–`02-§32.8` — HTML validation in CI**
    No HTML linter is configured; invalid HTML does not fail the build.
    Requirements added in §32; implementation in progress.

3. **`CL-§5.2` / `02-§33.1`–`02-§33.8` — CSS linting in CI**
    No CSS linter is configured.
    Requirements added in §33; implementation in progress.

4. **`02-§13.2` / `07-§9.2` — Visible focus states** *(resolved)*
    `:focus-visible` rules added to all interactive elements in `style.css`:
    `outline: 2px solid var(--color-terracotta); outline-offset: 2px`.
    Form inputs retain their `:focus` border-color change and gain the outline on `:focus-visible`.

5. **`02-§13.6` / `07-§9.5` — Accordion ARIA attributes** *(resolved)*
    Native `<details>/<summary>` elements satisfy the ARIA requirement — browsers expose
    expanded/collapsed state to assistive technology without explicit attributes.
    Custom accordion components (archive timeline) already use explicit `aria-expanded`
    and `aria-controls` (ARK-04, ARK-05). Design doc updated to codify this decision.

6. **`02-§34.1`–`02-§34.14` — Derived active camp** *(resolved)*
   The `active` flag has been removed from `camps.yaml`. The active camp
   is now derived from dates at build and API time. 8 covered (DAC-01..07),
   5 implemented (manual/code review). 05-§1.3 superseded.

11 requirements added for descriptive image filenames (02-§68.1–68.11):
  8 covered (FNM-01..09): naming convention, reference integrity.
  3 implemented (manual): alt-text match, CSS selector update, no content change.
  39 of 51 image files renamed. One alt-text change: RFSBlogo → RFSB logo.
  CSS selector updated: `.content-img[alt="RFSB logo"]`.

| `02-§93.6` | implemented | Node: `express-rate-limit` keys on `req.ip`, resolved through Express `app.set('trust proxy', 'loopback')` in `app.js`. PHP: `api/index.php` `clientIp()` reads `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` then `REMOTE_ADDR` |
| `02-§93.7` | implemented | `app.js` defines `makeLimiter()` and four named instances (`verifyAdminLimiter`, `editEventLimiter`, `deleteEventLimiter`, `feedbackLimiter`); `source/api/rate-limit.js` and its tests removed in favour of the standard middleware |
| `02-§93.8` | implemented | `feedbackLimiter` on the `/feedback` route uses `{limit:5, windowMs:3_600_000}`, preserving §73.14 |
| `02-§93.9` | implemented | `api/src/RateLimit.php` provides `SBSommar\RateLimit::isLimited($ip, $ns, $limit, $window)` with JSON-file state in sys_get_temp_dir() — unchanged |
| `02-§93.10` | implemented | `api/src/Feedback.php` delegates to `RateLimit::isLimited` with the feedback namespace; unchanged |
| `02-§93.11` | implemented | Documented in 03-architecture/platform-and-security.md §31.3 (middleware's default in-memory store auto-cleans), §31.4 (PHP JSON file), §31.7 |
| `02-§93.12` | implemented | `app.js` `RATE_LIMIT_MSG` = "För många förfrågningar. Försök igen senare." emitted via the middleware's `handler` override; PHP `RATE_LIMIT_MSG` in `api/index.php` unchanged |
| `02-§93.13` | implemented | `package.json` declares `express-rate-limit` as the sole added runtime dependency, justified by CodeQL detectability and standard `Retry-After` / `RateLimit-*` headers |
| `02-§93.14` | implemented | `api/composer.json` unchanged by this feature |
| `02-§93.15` | implemented | `app.js` sets `app.set('trust proxy', 'loopback')`; documented in 03-architecture/platform-and-security.md §31.7 |

### §94 — Registration Banner and CTA Button

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `02-§94.1` | covered | REGB-08, REGB-10: `renderRegistrationBannersHtml` emits a banner per non-archived camp with title + meta; rendered inside hero area |
| `02-§94.2` | covered | REGB-04: each banner's `<a>` carries `href="#anmalan"` |
| `02-§94.3` | implemented | `source/build/build.js` sorts `registrationCamps` ascending by `start_date` before passing to `renderIndexPage`; verified in rendered HTML |
| `02-§94.4` | covered | REGC-03, REGC-06: CTA `href` is the `REGISTRATION_URL` defined in `source/build/render-index.js`; label is "Anmäl er här" |
| `02-§94.5` | implemented | `source/assets/cs/style.css` `.registration-cta { display: block; margin: 0 0 var(--space-md) 0 }` + `.registration-cta-btn { display: inline-block }`; button sits on its own line under the section heading — manual browser verification |
| `02-§94.6` | implemented | No media query; identical layout on desktop and mobile — manual browser verification |
| `02-§94.7` | covered | REG-06: `source/content/registration.md` contains no bold `[Anmäl er här]` link |
| `02-§94.8` | implemented | `source/data/camps.yaml` carries `registration_opens` / `registration_closes` for 2026-06, 2026-07, and qa-thisweek; validator enforces presence |
| `02-§94.9` | covered | VCMP-38..43: `source/scripts/validate-camps.js` rejects missing / invalid / out-of-order values on non-archived camps |
| `02-§94.10` | covered | VCMP-45: archived camp without the fields is accepted |
| `02-§94.11` | covered | REGB-05, REGB-06: banners emit `hidden` + `data-opens` / `data-closes` |
| `02-§94.12` | implemented | `render-index.js` inline script toggles `hidden` via Stockholm-anchored `today` string compare — REGB-11 verifies script presence; manual browser date-window check |
| `02-§94.13` | implemented | `.hero-registration-banner[hidden] { display: none }` in `style.css`; banners start hidden in HTML so no flicker — manual browser verification |
| `02-§94.14` | implemented | `build.js` filters `archived !== true` before building `registrationCamps`; archived camps never produce banners |
| `02-§94.15` | covered | REGC-01: `.registration-cta` wrapper is injected into the `anmalan` section by `injectRegistrationCta()` (same post-process pattern as `wrapTestimonialCards`); not authored in markdown |
| `02-§94.16` | covered | REGC-04: CTA anchor carries `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"` |
| `02-§94.17` | covered | REGC-02: CTA anchor has the `btn-primary` class |

| `02-§94.20` | covered | REGB-08 asserts "Anmälan"/"öppen"; REGB-09 asserts "Sista anmälningsdag"; REGC-06 asserts "Anmäl er här" |
| `02-§94.21` | implemented | `style.css` new rules use only `--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--font-size-*` tokens from `07-DESIGN.md §7` |
| `02-§94.22` | covered | REGB-11 / REGB-12: inline banner visibility script is emitted only when banners are present; no new JS files |
| `02-§94.23` | implemented | `package.json` and `api/composer.json` unchanged by this feature |

### §95 — Security Hygiene: Regex Performance and Escaping

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `02-§95.1` | covered | SLUG-RD-01, SLUG-RD-02: `slugify()` trim collapsed to `/^-\|-$/g`; pathological `-`-heavy input returns under 50 ms |
| `02-§95.2` | covered | SLUG-RD-03..14: `slugify(s)` matches reference implementation and honours 48-char cap, no leading/trailing dash |
| `02-§95.3` | covered | RE-01..18: `tests/helpers/regex-escape.js` escapes `. * + ? ^ $ { } ( ) \| [ ] \` and coerces non-string input |
| `02-§95.4` | implemented | `tests/scoped-headings.test.js` imports `escapeRegExp` and uses it at lines 50, 134, 156; no hand-rolled `\.`/`\s+` escape remains — all 22 SH-* tests still pass |
| `02-§95.5` | implemented | `package.json` and `api/composer.json` unchanged by this feature |
| `02-§95.6` | covered | SLUG-RD-03..12 prove output equivalence; SLUG-RD-14 guarantees no leading/trailing dash regression |
| `02-§95.7` | covered | CodeQL post-merge scan on main confirmed alerts #17, #30, #31, #32 transitioned to state `fixed` |

### §96 — Self-Healing Service Worker Upgrade

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `02-§96.1` | covered | OFF-02, PWA-31: `sw.js` declares `const CACHE_NAME = 'sb-sommar-v6'` |
| `02-§96.2` | covered | SWH-01: `install` event handler contains `self.skipWaiting()` |
| `02-§96.3` | covered | SWH-02: `install` handler wraps each URL as `new Request(u, { cache: 'reload' })` before `cache.addAll` |
| `02-§96.4` | covered | SWH-03, SWH-04: `activate` handler deletes caches `!== CACHE_NAME` and calls `self.clients.claim()` |
| `02-§96.5` | covered | SWH-05: primary `caches.match(request)` in `cacheFirstThenNetwork` has no `ignoreSearch`; secondary `ignoreSearch` match exists only on the fetch-failure branch |
| `02-§96.6` | covered | SWH-06, SWH-07, OFF-09: `networkFirstThenCache` and `networkFirstWithOfflineFallback` retain `{ ignoreSearch: true }` on their catch-branch cache lookups |
| `02-§96.7` | implemented | `source/build/build.js` pre-cache-manifest injection uses root-relative paths (no query strings); verified post-build by `public/sw.js` contents |
| `02-§96.8` | implemented | `cacheFirstThenNetwork` catch branch calls `caches.match(request, { ignoreSearch: true })` so `/style.css` pre-cache entry still serves offline — manual browser verification |
| `02-§96.9` | implemented | Manual browser verification: load SW v5, deploy v6, confirm next navigation upgrades without user action |
| `02-§96.10` | implemented | Manual browser verification: confirm `sb-sommar-v5` is deleted on activate and `sb-sommar-v6` populated from fresh network responses |
| `02-§96.11` | implemented | Manual browser verification: confirm §94 registration-banner styling applies on second reload after deploy |
| `02-§96.12` | implemented | Manual browser verification: no clear-site-data or unregister action required from the end user |
| `02-§96.13` | covered | SWH-08: `sw.js` has no `import`, `require`, or `importScripts` |
| `02-§96.14` | implemented | `package.json` unchanged by this feature |
| `02-§96.15` | implemented | `offline-guard.js`, `feedback.js`, and `offline.html` unchanged; offline routing in `sw.js` preserved — manual browser verification |

### §97 — Project Documentation Site

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `02-§97.1` | implemented | Pages enabled; `gh api repos/moggleif/sbsommar/pages` returns status `built` with `html_url=https://moggleif.github.io/sbsommar/` |

| `02-§97.3` | implemented | Pages' built-in automatic deploy runs on every push to `main` that touches `docs/`; verified after the initial enablement |
| `02-§97.4` | implemented | `docs/` contains only project documentation; no secrets, env values, or non-docs files — manual content review during this PR |
| `02-§97.5` | implemented | `docs/_config.yml` relies on GitHub Pages' built-in Jekyll; no project workflow added (verified by absence in `.github/workflows/`) |
| `02-§97.6` | implemented | DOCS-CFG-03 / DOCS-CFG-04: `docs/_config.yml` activates `jekyll-relative-links` and `relative_links.enabled: true`; runtime `.md → .html` resolution verified manually in the browser |
| `02-§97.7` | implemented | Manual browser verification: inline `<!-- 02-§N.M -->` markers remain as HTML comments in rendered output and are not visible |
| `02-§97.8` | implemented | `package.json` and `api/composer.json` unchanged by this feature (verified in PR diff) |
| `02-§97.9` | implemented | `.github/workflows/` unchanged; no Pages-specific workflow added (verified in PR diff) |
| `02-§97.10` | implemented | `deploy-qa.yml`, `deploy-prod.yml`, `deploy-reusable.yml`, `event-data-deploy.yml`, and `event-data-deploy-post-merge.yml` are untouched in this PR |
| `02-§97.11` | implemented | No `docs/CNAME` file; default `*.github.io` URL in use |
| `02-§97.12` | implemented | `docs/index.md` lists every other docs file with a one-line description and an `.md` link; `jekyll-relative-links` resolves the links to rendered pages — manual browser verification |
| `02-§97.13` | covered | README-DOCS-01, README-DOCS-02: `README.md` links to `https://moggleif.github.io/sbsommar/` and the link sits above the `## For Developers` section |
| `02-§97.14` | covered | README-DOCS-03, README-DOCS-04: `README.md` doc table includes all 10 `docs/*.md` files; drift test keeps the expected list in sync with `docs/` contents |
| `02-§97.15` | covered | DOCS-IDX-01..03: `docs/index.md` carries the reverse-discoverability banner with absolute github.com links to repo, README, and issues |
| `02-§97.16` | covered | DOCS-IDX-04: `docs/index.md` no longer contains any `https://sbsommar.se` link |
| `02-§97.17` | covered | DOCS-IDX-05: `docs/index.md` main copy is project-technical; no camp marketing phrases (`family camp`, `gifted children`, `Sysslebäck`) |
| `02-§97.18` | implemented | Policy declaration; satisfied collectively by §97.19, §97.20, §97.21 |

| `02-§97.21` | covered | DOCS-CFG-07: no `sitemap.xml`, `sitemap.txt`, or forbidden Jekyll plugins (`jekyll-sitemap`, `jekyll-seo-tag`, `jekyll-feed`) under `docs/` |

### §98 — Locale Overview Page

Session 1 of issue #332. Delivers `/lokaler.html` as a week-wide visual
timeline of which locales are already booked during the active camp.
Session 2 (a separate later change) will add a soft conflict warning in
the add- and edit-activity forms that links to this page.

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `02-§98.1` | covered | `source/build/render-lokaler.js` — `renderLokalerPage`; `source/build/build.js` writes `public/lokaler.html`; tests LOK-30, LOK-70 |
| `02-§98.2` | covered | `groupEventsByLocation()` preserves `local.yaml` order; tests LOK-01, LOK-40 |

| `02-§98.5` | covered | `renderEventBlock()` emits title, time range, responsible spans; tests LOK-50, LOK-51 |
| `02-§98.6` | covered | Empty locales get the italic `.lokal-empty` sub-label "Inga bokningar"; test LOK-42 |
| `02-§98.7` | covered | `groupEventsByLocation()` folds unknown locations under "Annat"; tests LOK-04, LOK-05, LOK-08, LOK-43 |
| `02-§98.8` | implemented | "Se lokalöversikt →" link in `source/build/render.js` schedule intro and `source/build/render-add.js` add intro. Manual: open /schema.html and /lagg-till.html, click link |
| `02-§98.9` | covered | `source/build/layout.js` untouched — no nav entry added; test LOK-61 |
| `02-§98.10` | covered | `<h1>Lokalöversikt</h1>`; `<html lang="sv">`; test LOK-31 |
| `02-§98.11` | covered | `ariaLabelFor()` builds locale/date/time/title/responsible string; test LOK-52 |
| `02-§98.12` | covered | `.lokaler-legend` placed before `.lokaler-grid-wrapper` in `renderLokalerPage`; test LOK-62 |
| `02-§98.13` | covered | Entire grid server-rendered at build; no `lokaler.js` referenced; test LOK-63 |
| `02-§98.14` | implemented | All `style.css` §6.104–6.115 rules use `var(--color-*)`, `var(--space-*)`, `color-mix()` derivations; manual: grep `source/assets/cs/style.css` for hex values inside `.lokaler-*` / `.event-block*` / `.day-band*` rules |
| `02-§98.15` | implemented | `.lokaler-grid-wrapper { overflow-x: auto }`; `@media (max-width: 600px)` shrinks `--lokaler-*-col`. Manual: open /lokaler.html at ≤600px viewport, confirm horizontal scroll and surrounding layout intact |

| `02-§98.23` | covered | Native `<table>`/`<tr>`/`<th scope="row">`/`<th scope="col">`/`<td>` in `renderLokalerPage`; CSS `display: grid` on `<table>` and `display: contents` on `<tr>` make them participate in CSS Grid; test LOK-86. CSS source-order invariant for clash-hover guarded by LOK-87 |

### §99 — Conflict warning in forms and activity pages

Session 2 of issue #332. Adds a red-dampened conflict banner to
`/lagg-till.html`, `/redigera.html`, and each per-event detail page
(`/schema/<slug>/`) when the activity's date/time/place overlaps
another booking. The overlap predicate lives in a single shared
UMD module `source/assets/js/client/conflict-check.js`, consumed by
both the client-side forms and the build-time renderers (including a
refactor of `render-lokaler.js` onto the shared module).

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `02-§99.1` | covered | `source/assets/js/client/conflict-check.js` exports `effectiveEnd`, `overlaps`, `markClashes`, `findConflicts`, `findConflictsMulti`; tests CNF-01..32 |
| `02-§99.2` | covered | `render-lokaler.js` and `render-event.js` both `require('../assets/js/client/conflict-check.js')`; no inline overlap predicate remains. Test CNF-02-RefactoredLokaler |
| `02-§99.3` | covered | Same-date + same-location + strict overlap; back-to-back is not a clash; cross-midnight end → 24:00. Tests CNF-01..14, CNF-20..23, CNF-40..41 |
| `02-§99.4` | implemented | `lagg-till.js` `whenEvents()` — lazy singleton promise wrapping `fetch('/events.json')`. Manual: DevTools Network → load /lagg-till.html, confirm one request |
| `02-§99.5` | implemented | `lagg-till.js` `maybeCheckConflicts()` wired to `change` events on `#f-start`/`#f-end`/`#f-location` and click on `.day-btn`; 150 ms debounce. Manual: fill all four fields, confirm banner appears |
| `02-§99.6` | covered | `renderConflicts()` in `lagg-till.js` emits banner before submit via `submitBtn.parentNode.insertBefore`; per-date sections via `findConflictsMulti` with CNF-30..32 |
| `02-§99.7` | covered | Banner footer hard-coded `<a href="lokaler.html">Se lokalöversikt →</a>`; CNF-64 asserts per-event variant; same string literal in `lagg-till.js` and `redigera.js` |
| `02-§99.8` | implemented | Submit handler is unchanged; conflict state only drives banner visibility. Manual: submit lagg-till with banner visible, confirm form posts |
| `02-§99.9` | implemented | `ensureConflictBanner()` sets `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`. Manual: verify with a screen reader |
| `02-§99.10` | implemented | `redigera.js` `scheduleConflictCheck()` called in the `.then()` handler after `populate()`; change listeners on `#f-date`/`#f-start`/`#f-end`/`#f-location`. CNF-52, CNF-54 check wiring |
| `02-§99.11` | covered | `findConflicts(..., { excludeId: els.id.value })` in `redigera.js`; tested via CNF-24 |
| `02-§99.12` | implemented | First `scheduleConflictCheck()` fires immediately after `populate(event)`. Manual: open a known-clashing event and confirm banner renders on load |
| `02-§99.13` | implemented | All strings (`Den här tiden…`, `Se lokalöversikt →`, weekday names via `WEEKDAYS_LONG_SV`) are Swedish literals in `lagg-till.js`, `redigera.js`, `render-event.js` |
| `02-§99.14` | implemented | `.conflict-warning` in `source/assets/cs/style.css` uses `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-error) 35%, var(--color-white))`, identical to `.event-block--clash`. Manual: DevTools Computed background on /lokaler.html event-block and banner — same values |
| `02-§99.15` | covered | `render-event.js` `renderConflictBanner(event, allEvents)` called per page with `excludeId: event.id`; `build.js` passes `events` array. Tests CNF-60, CNF-60b, CNF-61, CNF-62 |
| `02-§99.16` | covered | Both renderers emit `<div class="conflict-warning">…__lead/__list/__footer</div>`; a single CSS rule in `style.css` styles both. Tests CNF-50, CNF-53, CNF-60..64 |
| `02-§99.17` | covered | `render-event.js` template interpolates `${conflictHtml}${descriptionHtml}${linkHtml}` inside `.event-detail`. Test CNF-63 |
| `02-§99.18` | implemented | `redigera.js` `ensureConflictBanner()` inserts before the first `<fieldset>` in `#edit-form`. Manual: open /redigera.html?id=<clashing>, confirm banner appears between the "Redigera aktivitet" heading and the Rubrik field |

### §100 — Secret File Protection: API `.env` Outside the Web Root

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `02-§100.1` | gap | Planned: deploy workflow keeps `.env` at `$DEPLOY_DIR/.env`, never under `public_html`; ENVLOC tests + manual server check |
| `02-§100.2` | gap | Planned: `api/index.php` loads via `Dotenv::createImmutable(dirname(__DIR__, 2))`; HTACC test asserts path |
| `02-§100.3` | gap | Planned: PHP reads `GITHUB_*`, origins, `COOKIE_DOMAIN`, `BUILD_ENV`, `ADMIN_TOKENS` from `$DEPLOY_DIR/.env` — manual server verification |
| `02-§100.4` | gap | Planned: `api/.htaccess` denies dotfiles; HTACC test asserts deny rule + manual `curl /api/.env` → 403 |
| `02-§100.5` | gap | Planned: `source/static/.htaccess` denies `.env`; HTACC test asserts rule propagated to `public/.htaccess` |
| `02-§100.6` | gap | Planned: manual verification — `curl -I https://sbsommar.se/api/.env` and QA return 403/404 |
| `02-§100.7` | gap | Planned: API tar uses `--exclude='.env'`; ENVLOC test asserts no restore-into-webroot step |
| `02-§100.8` | gap | Planned: workflow migrates legacy `public_html/api/.env` to `$DEPLOY_DIR/.env`; ENVLOC test asserts migration block |
| `02-§100.9` | gap | Planned: no new npm/Composer deps — `package.json`/`composer.json` unchanged |
| `02-§100.10` | gap | Planned: local Node API unaffected — `app.js` uses `--env-file=.env`; no PHP locally |
| `02-§100.11` | gap | Supersedes §53.3 — `.env` outside swapped `public_html` persists without backup; ENVLOC test asserts backup/restore steps removed |

### §1 — Camp registry fields (camps.yaml)

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `05-§1.7` | covered | VCMP-37..45: validator enforces ISO format, ordering (`registration_opens <= registration_closes`), and `registration_closes < start_date` on non-archived camps; archived camps may omit the fields |

# SB Sommar – Architecture: Data Layer

Camp YAML files, the central metadata registry, active-camp resolution, the archive layer, the shared footer, and search-engine blocking.

Part of [the architecture index](./index.md). Section IDs (`03-§N.M`) are stable and cited from code; they do not encode the file path.

---

## 1. Data Layer

Each camp has exactly one YAML file in `source/data/`:

```text
source/data/2025-06-syssleback.yaml
source/data/2025-08-syssleback.yaml
source/data/2026-06-syssleback.yaml
```

Each file contains:

- Camp metadata (name, dates, location)
- A list of events

Events are unique on the combination of `(title + date + start)`.

This is the single source of truth for all camp content.

---

## 2. Metadata Layer

`source/data/camps.yaml` is the central registry of all camps, past and present.

It contains:

- All camps (active, archived, and upcoming)
- Their date ranges
- Which file contains their events
- Which camp is currently active

Example entry:

```yaml
camps:
  - id: 2026-06-syssleback
    name: SB Sommar Juni 2026
    start_date: 2026-06-28
    end_date: 2026-07-05
    file: 2026-06-syssleback.yaml
    archived: false
```

The site never hardcodes file names. It always reads from `camps.yaml` first.

The active camp is **derived at build time and API request time** — there is
no manual `active` flag. The derivation rules (in priority order):

1. **On dates** — today falls within `start_date..end_date` (inclusive).
2. **Next upcoming** — nearest future `start_date`.
3. **Most recent** — latest `end_date`, even if archived.

If two camps overlap, the one with the earlier `start_date` wins.

The derivation logic lives in `source/scripts/resolve-active-camp.js` and is
shared by `build.js` and the API (`github.js`).

### QA camp isolation

Camps may have an optional `qa: true` field. QA camps are filtered based on
the `BUILD_ENV` environment variable:

- **Production** (`BUILD_ENV=production`): QA camps are excluded from
  the camps array at the top of `build.js`, before the array is passed
  to `resolveActiveCamp()` or any rendering function. This ensures QA
  camps never appear in production output (schedule, index camp list,
  archive, RSS, calendar, or API responses).
- **QA** (`BUILD_ENV=qa`): QA camps that are on dates take priority over
  non-QA camps, ensuring the QA camp is always active in QA.
- **Local** (`BUILD_ENV` unset): No filtering — all camps are included
  and normal derivation rules apply.

Two QA-only camps coexist in `camps.yaml` to provide a continuous QA
testing window without overlapping the real-camp season:

- A spring QA camp (`qa-thisweek`) runs through the off-season and
  closes two weeks before the next real camp's `start_date`, leaving
  the real-camp window QA-free.
- An autumn QA camp (`qa-testcamp`) covers October 1 through December
  31 of the current year, reopening QA testing once the real-camp
  season ends.

See `02-requirements/event-data.md §42` for the full data model and seasonal rules.

## 3. Active Camp and Event Submissions

During camp week, participants submit activities through the `/lagg-till.html` form.

The API server (`app.js`) handles each submission as follows:

1. Validates the incoming event data, including security scanning for injection patterns and link protocol validation (see [`ci-and-deploy.md`](./ci-and-deploy.md) §11.6).
2. Responds immediately with a success confirmation — the form does not wait for the rest of the process.
3. Reads `source/data/camps.yaml` from GitHub via the Contents API.
4. Derives the active camp from dates and reads its YAML file from GitHub.
5. Appends the new event, then parses the complete proposed document and confirms it contains the new event id before any branch is created (02-§102.5); on a parse failure nothing is written to git. The serialised YAML block is indented to match the existing `events:` list so the file remains valid YAML.
6. Opens a pull request with auto-merge enabled.
7. The event data PR check (see [`ci-and-deploy.md`](./ci-and-deploy.md) §11) runs — a no-op that satisfies branch protection.
8. The PR merges automatically via auto-merge.
9. The post-merge event data deploy workflow (see [`ci-and-deploy.md`](./ci-and-deploy.md) §11) installs production dependencies via `setup-node` + `npm ci --omit=dev`, builds the site, and uploads event-data pages to QA and Production.

The updated schedule is visible to participants within minutes of submission.

The active camp's YAML file is always version-controlled. Git history provides a full audit trail of every event submitted through the form.

    end
```

### 3.1 Batch event submissions (recurring activities)

A batch endpoint `POST /add-events` (Node.js) and `POST /api/add-events` (PHP)
accepts the same fields as the single-event endpoint but with `dates` (an array)
instead of `date`. <!-- 03-§3.1 -->

The flow is identical to the single-event flow above, with two differences:

1. **Validation**: every date in the array is validated against camp range,
   past-date rules, and uniqueness `(title + date + start)` before any write.
   If any date fails, the entire batch is rejected. <!-- 03-§3.1a -->
2. **Commit**: all events are appended to the camp YAML file and committed in a
   single branch and PR — not one PR per event. <!-- 03-§3.1b -->

The session cookie is updated with all new event IDs (when consent is given).

### 3.2 Day grid on add-activity form

The add-activity form replaces the native `<input type="date">` with a grid of
day buttons rendered at build time from the active camp's `start_date` and
`end_date`. <!-- 03-§3.2 -->

Each button shows the Swedish weekday abbreviation and date (e.g. "Mån 28/7").
A "Återkommande" toggle switches the grid between single-select (default) and
multi-select mode. In single-select, exactly one day is selected. In
multi-select, multiple days can be toggled on/off. <!-- 03-§3.2a -->

Client-side date filtering: when today falls within the camp period, only days
from today onward are shown. This uses the same date comparison logic as the
existing past-date blocking ([`forms-and-api.md`](./forms-and-api.md) §13). <!-- 03-§3.2b -->

### 3.3 API error classification

When a GitHub API call fails during event submission (add, batch-add, or edit),
the PHP API classifies the error before returning it to the client. <!-- 03-§3.3 -->

| HTTP status from GitHub | Category | Swedish user message | Actionable? |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| 401 / 403 (no rate-limit) | Auth | Servern kunde inte ansluta till GitHub. Kontakta arrangören. | No — config |
| 403 (rate-limit) / 429 | Rate limit | För många förfrågningar just nu. Försök igen om några minuter. | Yes — wait |
| 409 / 422 | Conflict | En skrivkonflikt uppstod. Försök igen. | Yes — retry |
| 5xx | GitHub error | GitHub har tillfälliga problem. Försök igen om en stund. | Yes — wait |
| curl timeout / no response | Network | Kunde inte nå GitHub. Kontrollera att tjänsten är tillgänglig. | Maybe |
| Other | Unknown | Ett oväntat fel uppstod. Försök igen eller kontakta arrangören. | Maybe |

The classification is implemented in a single helper method so all three
mutation endpoints share the same logic. Error messages never expose tokens,
file paths, or stack traces. <!-- 03-§3.3a -->

## 4. Archive Layer

After camp ends:

1. Set `archived: true` for the camp in `source/data/camps.yaml`.
2. Commit the change — the YAML file becomes the permanent archive.
3. Deploy. The system automatically derives the next active camp from dates.

No data is ever lost.

---

## 4a. Archive Page Rendering

At build time, `source/build/render-arkiv.js` produces `public/arkiv.html`.

Data sources:

- `camps.yaml` — camp metadata (name, dates, location, information, link).
- Per-camp event YAML files (referenced via the `file:` field in `camps.yaml`) —
  event data for the event list inside each accordion panel.

Steps:

1. Filter `camps` to those with `archived: true`.
2. Sort descending by `start_date` (newest first).
3. For each archived camp, load its event YAML file (via the `file:` field in
   `camps.yaml`) and pass the events array to the template.
4. Render a vertical timeline: each camp is one `<li>` in an `<ol class="timeline">`.
5. Each timeline item contains:
   - A `<button>` accordion header showing the camp name, with date range and
     location in subdued text to the right.
   - A hidden `<div>` panel with:
     - Facebook logo link (if `link` is non-empty), using the image at
       `images/facebook-ikon.webp`.
     - Camp metadata (dates, location).
     - Information paragraph (if non-empty).
     - Event list grouped by day, using the same row format as the schedule page.
6. The panel is hidden/shown by toggling `aria-expanded` and `hidden` via
   `source/assets/js/client/arkiv.js` — no framework.
7. Only one panel may be open at a time; the JS closes any previously open panel
   before opening the new one.
8. The JS toggles a CSS class on the active timeline dot to highlight the
   selected camp on the timeline.

### Fields used from `camps.yaml`

| Field | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Accordion header (primary text) |
| `start_date` | Date range display; sort key; header metadata |
| `end_date` | Date range display; header metadata |
| `location` | Header metadata (gray text); location line in panel |
| `information` | Information paragraph (omitted if empty) |
| `link` | Facebook logo link (omitted if empty) |
| `file` | Path to per-camp event YAML for event list |

Dates are formatted in Swedish: `D månadsnamn YYYY` (e.g. "22 juni 2025").

### Archive page files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `source/build/render-arkiv.js` | Renders `public/arkiv.html` at build time |
| `source/assets/js/client/arkiv.js` | Accordion open/close + ARIA state on the archive page |

### Archive page changes to existing files

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `source/build/build.js` | Call `renderArkivPage(camps)` and write `public/arkiv.html` |
| `source/build/layout.js` | Add "Arkiv" nav link |

---

## 4b. Shared Site Footer

Every page produced by the build includes a `<footer class="site-footer">` element
at the bottom of `<body>`.

### Content source

Footer content lives in `source/content/footer.md`. Non-technical contributors
can edit this file to change the footer on all pages without touching any template
or render function.

### Build-time rendering

`source/build/build.js`:

1. Reads `source/content/footer.md` at the start of the build, before rendering
   any page.
2. Converts the Markdown to HTML using `convertMarkdown()` from
   `source/build/render-index.js` (powered by the `marked` library; the same
   pipeline used for homepage sections).
3. If the file does not exist, `footerHtml` is set to an empty string — no error,
   no crash.
4. Passes `footerHtml` as an argument to every render function.

### Render functions

Each render function (`renderSchedulePage`, `renderTodayPage`, `renderIdagPage`,
`renderAddPage`, `renderEditPage`, `renderArkivPage`, `renderIndexPage`) accepts
`footerHtml` as its last argument. It calls `pageFooter(footerHtml)` from
`source/build/layout.js` and places the result immediately before `</body>`.

`pageFooter(footerHtml)`:

- Returns `<footer class="site-footer">…</footer>` when `footerHtml` is non-empty.
- Returns an empty string when `footerHtml` is empty (file-missing fallback).

### No duplication

No render function contains literal footer text. The Markdown file is the single
source of truth. Updating `footer.md` and rebuilding changes the footer on every
page simultaneously.

### Files changed

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `source/content/footer.md` | New file — footer content in Markdown |
| `source/build/layout.js` | Add `pageFooter(footerHtml)` |
| `source/build/build.js` | Load `footer.md`, convert to HTML, pass to all render calls |
| `source/build/render.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-today.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-idag.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-add.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-edit.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-arkiv.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-index.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/assets/cs/style.css` | Add `.site-footer` styles |

## 4c. Search Engine and Crawler Blocking

The site is intentionally hidden from search engines. Two mechanisms enforce this:

### robots.txt

`source/build/build.js` writes `public/robots.txt` during the build:

```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

This tells well-behaved crawlers not to index any page.

### Meta robots tag

Every HTML page includes a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` tag
in its `<head>` section. This is the browser-level signal that reinforces
`robots.txt` for crawlers that follow the meta tag standard.

Each render function (`renderSchedulePage`, `renderTodayPage`, `renderIdagPage`,
`renderAddPage`, `renderEditPage`, `renderArkivPage`, `renderIndexPage`) emits
the tag as part of its `<head>` block.

### Crawler-blocking files changed

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `source/build/build.js` | Write `public/robots.txt` during build |
| `source/build/render.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-today.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-idag.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-add.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-edit.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-arkiv.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-index.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
